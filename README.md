## Notes - During the process:
While trying to parse the movie titles via yts.mx inspect code, I tried using single quotes as the YouTube video demostrated.
However, using single quotes did not work for me, I had to use Double quotes.  

## During the process of coding in C#:
While I could not use the single quotes while searching the inspect code, I did in fact have to use single quotes in Visual Studio... 
("//a[@class='browse-movie-title']"))
